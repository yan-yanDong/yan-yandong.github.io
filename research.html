<h2>Research Statement</h2>
    </ul>
    I am broadly interested in information theory and online learning. During my doctoral studies, I focused on the open problem 
    of verifying optimal finite-blocklength block codes under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding.  <br />
  In particular, I investigated optimal 
    codes with four codewords over a wide range of blocklengths for binary symmetric channels (BSCs).  <br />
  I also analyzed the scalability of 
    communication performance in line networks as the number of hops grows, under both latency and buffer constraints. This analysis 
    was conducted in two settings: line networks composed of general discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) and those affected by slow 
    fading with outage events. 
   <br />
  In addition, I studied network utility optimization in multi-flow wireless networks employing network 
    coding.  <br />
  As a postdoctoral researcher, I have expanded my research to include multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, with a focus on 
    both theoretical foundations and practical extensions involving constraints such as switching costs and delayed feedback.<br />

<h3>Online Learning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Adversarial Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with Switching Cost<p>
    <p> 
      I studied the adversarial combinatorial multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem where switching between selected arms across rounds 
      incurs a cost.  To characterize the inherent difficulty of this problem, I derived minimax lower bounds on the regret to
      understand the fundamental performance limits, and developed 
      algorithms with provable upper bounds under both bandit and semi-bandit feedback. While the tightness of the bounds remains
      open, the results shed light on the complexity introduced by switching constraints and suggest directions for further refinement.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multi-Armed Bandit with Delayed Feedback<p>
    <p>I am currently working on the best arm identification problem under delayed feedback, aiming to develop algorithms that 
      can effectively accommodate such delays. 
      The goal is to minimize the sample complexity in the fixed-confidence setting while accounting for feedback latency.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimal Finite-Blocklength Codes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Optimal Finite Length Codes for Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs)<p>
    <p> As part of my interest in finite-length information theory, I have investigated the structure and performance of block codes 
      with short lengths. In particular, I focused on identifying codes with four codewords that maximize the probability of correct 
      decoding under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding for the binary symmetric channel (BSC). To enable rigorous comparisons,
      I developed a methodology for evaluating the ML decoding performance of codes with subtle structural differences. More broadly, 
      my research aims to understand the performance limits of finite-length codes from diverse perspectives and to design efficient
      codes and decoding schemes tailored to the short blocklength regime.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Network Coding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Capacity of Line Networks with DMCs or slow-fading channels<p>
    <p>
       I conducted scalability analysis of throughput and latency as the line network length increases, comparing 
       different coding schemes in a network affected by outages due to fading and interference. We compared the scalability of three schemes—random 
       linear network coding, retransmission, and store-and-forward—providing valuable insights for the design of multihop wireless communication 
       networks. Also, I have also took part in the study for the capacity scalability of line networks with DMCs under latency and buffer
       constraints.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network Utility Maximization with Network Coding<p>
    <p>I studied network utility optimization in multi-flow wireless networks 
      when using BATS (BATched Sparse) codes—a variation of random linear network coding. We jointly optimized the BATS code 
      parameters and network
      scheduling for all flows. </p>
