<h2>Research Statement</h2>
My research interests lie at the intersection of online learning, machine learning, and information theory, with a particular emphasis
  on finite-length codes and network coding. I am deeply committed to designing efficient algorithms and providing rigorous analysis to
  understand the theoretical underpinnings of these methods. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of algorithms that
  not only perform well in practice but also have a solid theoretical foundation, particularly in the context of complex communication 
  systems and optimization problems.

  In my research, I rely heavily on bound analysis to understand the performance of algorithms and the capacity of communication networks.
  By deriving upper and lower bounds for algorithmic performance, I can provide theoretical guarantees and insights into the efficiency of 
  the proposed methods. This approach is crucial for understanding the trade-offs in real-world applications, especially when the system’s resources or feedback are limited.

  Ultimately, my goal is to design algorithms that are both theoretically sound and practically applicable, offering strong performance 
  guarantees and insights into their behavior in complex, real-world settings. Through my work, I aspire to contribute to the development 
  of efficient communication systems and decision-making algorithms that can handle the inherent uncertainties and limitations of modern computing environments.
<h3>Online learning optimization</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Combinatorial multi-armed bandit with switching cost</p>
  One area of exploration was the combinatorial bandit problem with a cost associated with switching between selected arms in each round, 
  where I analyzed various feedback settings to understand the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. This work extended traditional
  bandit problems by introducing additional structural constraints, contributing to a deeper understanding of algorithmic decision-making in complex environments.

  <h3>Network Coding and Network Optimization</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Capacity of line networks with DMCs or outages</p>
  In the realm of network coding, I have examined the capacity of line networks in both discrete memoryless and wireless communication settings. 
  I applied network coding techniques to explore capacity limits and characterized the conditions under which network coding achieves optimal performance.
</li>
<li><p>Network Utility Maximization when network coding is involved</p>
   I have worked on network utility maximization problems when network coding is involved, aiming to develop algorithms that balance multiple objectives,
  such as throughput and fairness, while respecting the constraints of the network.

  <h3>Coding Theory with Finite Blocklength</h3>
  I analyzed the finite blocklength codes in the context of the binary symmetric channel and demonstrated how both linear and nonlinear codes 
  can be optimized under finite blocklength constraints.
