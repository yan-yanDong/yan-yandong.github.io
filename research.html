<h2>Research Statement</h2>
My research interests lie in the following four aspects: 
  <ul>
<li><p>Multi-armed bandits</p>
</li>  
<li><p>Finite-length coding theory</p>
</li>  
<li><p>Network coding and its applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>Theory in machine learning</p>
</li>
    </ul>
    I am broadly interested in information theory and online learning. During my doctoral studies, I focused on the open problem 
    of verifying optimal finite-blocklength block codes under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. In particular, I investigated optimal 
    codes with four codewords over a wide range of blocklengths for binary symmetric channels. I also analyzed the scalability of 
    communication performance in line networks as the number of hops grows, under both latency and buffer constraints. This analysis 
    was conducted in two settings: line networks composed of general discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) and those affected by slow 
    fading with outage events. In addition, I studied network utility optimization in multi-flow wireless networks employing network 
    coding. As a postdoctoral researcher, I have expanded my research to include multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, with a focus on 
    both theoretical foundations and practical extensions involving constraints such as switching costs and delayed feedback.<br />

    </ul>

<h3>Multi-armed bandits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with Switching Cost<p>
    <p>I studied the combinatorial bandit problem with a cost associated with switching between selected arms in each round. 
    I developed theoretical performance lower bounds and designed 
      efficient algorithms with low regret for both bandit and semi-bandit feedback scenarios, while accounting for switching costs incurred 
      when changing decisions between rounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multi-Armed Bandit with Delays on the Reward Feedback<p>
    <p>Another focus of my research has been on multi-armed bandit problems where the reward feedback is delayed, aiming to design algorithms 
      that efficiently handle such delays and minimize sample complexity of fixed-confidence best arm identification problem with the 
      feedback latency.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Network Coding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Capacity of Line Networks with DMCs or slow-fading channels<p>
    <p>
       I conducted scalability analysis of throughput and latency as the line network length increases, comparing 
       different coding schemes in a network affected by outages due to fading and interference. We compared the scalability of three schemes—random 
       linear network coding, retransmission, and store-and-forward—providing valuable insights for the design of multihop wireless communication 
       networks. 
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network Utility Maximization with Network Coding<p>
    <p>I studied network utility optimization in multi-flow wireless networks 
      when using BATS (BATched Sparse) codes—a variation of random linear network coding. We jointly optimized the BATS code 
      parameters and network
      scheduling for all flows. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimal Finite-Blocklength Codes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Optimal Finite Length Codes for Binary Symmetric Channels (BSC)<p>
    <p> I have focused on codes with short block lengths, particularly designing block codes that maximize the ML decoding probability for BSC.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
