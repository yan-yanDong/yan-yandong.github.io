<h2>Research Statement</h2>
My research interests lie in the following four aspects: 
  <ul>
<li><p>Finite-length coding theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-armed bandits</p>
</li>    
<li><p>Network coding and its applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>Theory in machine learning</p>
</li>
    </ul>
   In general, I aim to improve machine learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on areas like online learning 
  and neural networks and address computational challenges in large language models (LLMs) using coding strategies. Additionally, I am interested 
  in designing block codes with short block lengths that maintain high performance in maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. <br />
  <ul>
  <li><p>In finite-length coding, I have focused on codes with short block lengths, particularly designing optimal block codes that maximize 
    the ML decoding probability for binary symmetric channels (BSC). <br /> </p>
  </li>
<li><p>In multi-armed bandits (MAB), I studied the theoretical analysis of the MAB problem with additional complexities, such as extra 
  costs beyond the traditional setting or delayed feedback. Specifically, I developed theoretical performance lower bounds and designed 
  efficient algorithms with low regret for both bandit and semi-bandit feedback scenarios, while accounting for switching costs incurred 
  when changing decisions between rounds. Additionally, I am working on addressing the best arm identification (BAI) problem in the presence of 
  feedback delays.  <br /></p>
  </li>
<li><p>In network coding,  I have worked on two major problems. First, I studied network utility optimization in multi-flow wireless networks 
  when using BATS (BATched Sparse) codes—a variation of random linear network coding. We jointly optimized the BATS code parameters and network
  scheduling for all flows. Second, I conducted scalability analysis of throughput and latency as the line network length increases, comparing 
  different coding schemes in a network affected by outages due to fading and interference. We compared the scalability of three schemes—random 
  linear network coding, retransmission, and store-and-forward—providing valuable insights for the design of multihop wireless communication 
  networks. <br /></p>
  </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Online Learning Optimization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with Switching Cost</h4>
    <p>One area of exploration was the combinatorial bandit problem with a cost associated with switching between selected arms in each round, where I analyzed various feedback settings to understand the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. This work extended traditional bandit problems by introducing additional structural constraints, contributing to a deeper understanding of algorithmic decision-making in complex environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Multi-Armed Bandit with Delays on the Reward Feedback</h4>
    <p>Another focus of my research has been on multi-armed bandit problems where the reward feedback is delayed, aiming to design algorithms that efficiently handle such delays and minimize regret despite the feedback latency.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Network Coding and Network Optimization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Capacity of Line Networks with DMCs or Outages</h4>
    <p>In the realm of network coding, I have examined the capacity of line networks in both discrete memoryless and wireless communication settings. I applied network coding techniques to explore capacity limits and characterized the conditions under which network coding achieves optimal performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Network Utility Maximization with Network Coding</h4>
    <p>I have worked on network utility maximization problems when network coding is involved, aiming to develop algorithms that balance multiple objectives, such as throughput and fairness, while respecting the constraints of the network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coding Theory with Finite Blocklength</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Optimal Finite Length Codes for Binary Symmetric Channels (BSC)</h4>
    <p>I analyzed finite blocklength codes in the context of binary symmetric channels and demonstrated how both linear and nonlinear codes can be optimized under finite blocklength constraints, with a focus on maximizing decoding probability.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
